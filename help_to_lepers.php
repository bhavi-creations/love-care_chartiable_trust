                    Leprosy is a curable disease, yet thousands of people suffer due to lack of awareness, medical facilities, and timely intervention. Many leprosy patients face severe health complications, including nerve damage and disabilities, if left untreated. Access to early diagnosis and proper medication can prevent long-term suffering and improve their quality of life.


                </p>
                <p>Our charitable trust is committed to providing free medical care, regular health check-ups, and essential medications to leprosy patients. We work closely with healthcare professionals to ensure timely treatment, rehabilitation, and awareness programs that help in early detection and prevention. By offering medical support, we aim to restore the health and dignity of those affected by this condition.
